Tweet-feed lets you easily read the content of all the URLs tweeted by people you follow on Twitter in your favorite news reader.  It does this by scanning your Twitter timeline for URLs, gets the content from those URLs and cleans them up using a readability plugin, and exposes them as an atom feed.

This lets me use Feedly to quickly read all the content shared by people I follow on Twitter.

I wrote this back in 2013 and have been using it continually since then.  The code and libraries quite are outdated, but it has been running on Heroku for all these years with no issues.
