## What does Tweed-Feed do?
Tweet-Feed lets you easily read the content of all the URLs tweeted by people you follow on Twitter in your favorite news reader.  It does this by scanning your Twitter timeline for URLs, gets the content from those URLs and cleans them up using a readability plugin, and exposes them as an atom feed.

This lets me use Feedly to quickly read all the content shared by people I follow on Twitter.

## Warning: This is old code with outdated libraries.
I wrote this back in 2013 and have used it continually for many years.  I haven't touched the code since I wrote it, so the libraries it uses are very outdated. You will probably want to update them before using this yourself.
